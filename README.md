# Interview Prepper

Welcome to **Interview Prepper**, the ultimate tool for preparing for coding interviews! This app combines the power of Google's Gemini API with Deepgram's speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality to provide an interactive, voice-driven interview practice experience. 🚀

### 🚧 Project Overview

The Interview Prepper helps you practice coding questions out loud and receive immediate feedback. It supports:

* **Interactive Q&A** : Users upload their resume, and the system generates questions based on it. You’ll answer out loud, and your answers will be evaluated in real-time.
* **Leetcode Challenges** : You can solve coding problems, run your code, and get dynamic hints when your solution doesn't pass all test cases.
* **Speech-to-Speech Responses** : With near-instant feedback (less than 2 seconds), the app uses Deepgram and Gemini to generate feedback in real-time after each answer or code submission.

### 💻 Tech Stack

* **Frontend** : React, JavaScript
* **Backend** : Flask
* **APIs** :
* Google Gemini for generating dynamic interview questions and feedback.
* Deepgram for speech recognition and synthesis (turns speech into text and text back into speech).

### ⚙️ Features

* **Resume Upload** : The app parses your resume and generates interview questions based on the content.
* **Real-Time Speech Interaction** : Answer interview questions out loud, and the system will transcribe your responses using Deepgram.
* **Leetcode Code Evaluation** : Test your coding skills with real coding problems. Get real-time hints and feedback based on the number of test cases your code passes.
* **Quick Feedback** : You’ll receive quick feedback (< 2 seconds) after each question or coding submission.

### 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload Resume** : You upload your resume, and the system extracts the text and generates questions.
2. **Answer Questions Aloud** : The app asks questions based on your resume, and you answer out loud. Your responses are recorded and transcribed using Deepgram.
3. **Solve Leetcode Challenges** : Test your coding knowledge with custom coding challenges. The system runs test cases on your solution and provides hints if needed.
4. **Immediate Feedback** : After each question or coding submission, the app provides immediate feedback and hints to help improve your answers or solutions.
